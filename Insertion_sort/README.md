# Insertion Sort

### readRecords.c
contains functions to read records from the text file and store it in an array (realloc to re-size it dynamically). Time taken to load such files are also measured and output is given to a file.
### insertionSort.c and measureTimeAndSpace.c
a new credit card record can be inserted into the existing data sturcture using the insertion sort algorithm. Time and space taken for the insertion meachanism is also measured and compared with the theoreitcal standard.
